<h1>Read Me - Assignment 4</h1>

<ol><li>What is "alt text," and why do we use it?</li><br>
<ul><li>Alt text is a description of images online that allow for the vision impaired to understand what's happening in photos online. </li></ul><br>
<li>Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?</li><br>
<ul><li>I use forms on the web every single day, especially in my job. I work  from home as a customer service rep for an apparel company, and I spend all day filling out forms to try and figure out where people's shorts went and how I can get them to their houses. Finally understanding how they function online is a real treat.</li></ul><br>
<li>Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.</li><br>
<ul><li>This one I thouroughly enjoyed, mostly because I think I worked through the assignment while learning, which I hadn't done before. By doing that, I was much more engaged with what I was learning and how all of the things came together at the end.</li></ul><br>
<li>Embed a screenshot of your workspace at some point during your development cycle.</li></ol>
