<p><h1>Assignment 6</h1></p>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>My Mother was born in 1960, so she was a teenager during the 70's. She went to see
      incredible musicians in her hometown in California, and got to wear bell bottoms and
      flowy tops <b>every single day</b>. My father had been born in the 50's so he was a little
      older, but he also experienced this weird aesthetic of burnt oranges, avacado greens,
      and <i>disgusting</i> shag carpets.</p></div>

    <p>I LOVE THE 70's</p>
