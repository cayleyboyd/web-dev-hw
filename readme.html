# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Cayley Boyd

I decided to take this class because I have a passion for languages, and coding is definitely a language I want to be familiar with. I also think that web design is a very valuable skill to have, and I hope that I can use the skills that I learn in this class in whatever I choose to do in the future.

## Things I Learned From the "Q & A with the Internet" section
..*The internet is a physical thing, with physical cables that connect the world.
..*The internet and the web are two different things
..*The internet began as a seperate project for the Department of Defense
..*Men in scuba suits literally pull the internet wires onto the beach from the ocean.
